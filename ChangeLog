No ChangeLog files
===================

Do not write a ChangeLog file for npth.  We put change information
only in the GIT commit log, and generate a top-level ChangeLog file
from logs at "make dist" time.  As such, there are strict requirements
on the form of the commit log messages.  See HACKING for details.
